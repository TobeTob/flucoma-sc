TITLE:: FluidBuf* Multithreading Behaviour
SUMMARY:: A tutorial on the multithreading behaviour of offline processes of the FluCoMa toolbox for signal decomposition
CATEGORIES:: Libraries>FluidDecomposition
RELATED:: Guides/FluCoMa, Guides/FluidDecomposition

DESCRIPTION::
The Fluid Decomposition toolbox provides an open-ended, loosely coupled set of objects to break up and analyse sound in terms of slices (segments in time), layers (superositions in time and frequency) and objects (configurable or discoverable patterns in sound). Almost all objects have audio-rate and buffer-based versions. footnote::
This toolbox was made possible thanks to the FluCoMa project ( http://www.flucoma.org/ ) funded by the European Research Council ( https://erc.europa.eu/ ) under the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (grant agreement No 725899).::

subsection:: basic usage

	show the process method

	show the process returned variable

subsection:: kr usage

	show the kr monitoring graphically

	show the interruption

	show the interruption again, but in a still working synth, mapping the KR out to a pitch gliss


subsection:: bufnmf example

	just for shits and giggles

subsection: further reading

	a few tutorials on how fucked up it is, includign the thread sync and NRT thread in SC.
