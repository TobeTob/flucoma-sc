SUMMARY:: Buffer-Based Harmonic-Percussive Source Separation Using Median Filtering
CATEGORIES:: Libraries>FluidDecomposition, UGens>Buffer
RELATED:: Guides/FluCoMa, Guides/FluidDecomposition


DESCRIPTION::
This class triggers a Harmonic-Percussive Source Separation process (HPSS for short) on buffers on the non-real-time thread of the server. It implements a few academic papers (TODO:refs) with some bespoke improvements. It is part of the Fluid Decomposition Toolkit of the FluCoMa project. footnote::
This  was made possible thanks to the FluCoMa project ( http://www.flucoma.org/ ) funded by the European Research Council ( https://erc.europa.eu/ ) under the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (grant agreement No 725899).::

		The algorithm will take a buffer in, and will divide it in two or three outputs, depending on the mode: LIST::
	## an harmonic component;
	## a percussive component;
	## a residual of the previous two if the flag is set to inter-dependant thresholds. See the modeFlag below.::

	The whole process is based on the assumption that, in a spectrogram, a percussive element will be a vertical line (white-ish spectrum) and an harmonic component will be a horizontal line (same spectral bin sustained over time). The way to remove the noisiness inherent to the analysis is a median filter acting on binary masks, which are then applied to the spectrogram of the full file. More information on median filtering, and on HPSS for musicianly usage, are availabe in LINK::Guides/FluCoMa:: overview file.


CLASSMETHODS::

METHOD:: process
This is the method that calls for the HPSS to be calculated on a given source buffer.

ARGUMENT:: server
	The server on which the buffers to be processed are allocated.

ARGUMENT:: srcBufNum
	The index of the buffer to use as the source material to be decomposed through the NMF process. The different channels of multichannel buffers will be processing sequentially.

ARGUMENT:: startAt
	Where in the srcBuf should the NMF process start, in sample.

ARGUMENT:: nFrames
	How many frames should be processed.

ARGUMENT:: startChan
	For multichannel srcBuf, which channel should be processed first.

ARGUMENT:: nChans
	For multichannel srcBuf, how many channel should be processed.

ARGUMENT:: harmBufNum
	The index of the buffer where the extracted harmonic component will be reconstructed.

ARGUMENT:: percBufNum
	The index of the buffer where the extracted percussive component will be reconstructed.

ARGUMENT:: resBufNum
	The index of the buffer where the residual component will be reconstructed in mode 2.

ARGUMENT:: harmFiltSize
	The size in consecutive spectral frames of the median filter for the harmonic component.

ARGUMENT:: percFiltSize
	The size in spectral bins of the median filter for the percussive component.

ARGUMENT:: modeFlag
	The way the masking is happening on the spectrogram.
	table::
	## 0 || Original paper - the loudest winds.
	## 1 || Relative mode - the thresholds set next on the harmonic counterpart will decide of a binary masking, and the percussive mask is its complement.
	## 2 || Inter-dependant mode - the thresholds are independant on the harmonic and percussive component, but are then normalised to make a null sum and their difference is sent to the residual buffer.
	::

ARGUMENT:: htf1
	In modes 1 and 2, the frequency of the low part of the threshold for the harmonic filter.

ARGUMENT:: hta1
	In modes 1 and 2, the threshold of the low part for the harmonic filter. That threshold applies to all frequencies up to htf1.

ARGUMENT:: htf2
	In modes 1 and 2, the frequency of the hight part of the threshold for the harmonic filter.

ARGUMENT:: hta2
	In modes 1 and 2, the threshold of the high part for the harmonic filter. That threshold applies to all frequencies above htf2. The threshold between htf1 and htf2 is interpolated between hta1 and hta2.

ARGUMENT:: ptf1
	In mode 2, the frequency of the low part of the threshold for the percussive filter.

ARGUMENT:: pta1
	In mode 2, the threshold of the low part for the percussive filter. That threshold applies to all frequencies up to ptf1.

ARGUMENT:: ptf2
	In mode 2, the frequency of the hight part of the threshold for the percussive filter.

ARGUMENT:: pta2
	In mode 2, the threshold of the high part for the percussive filter. That threshold applies to all frequencies above ptf2. The threshold between ptf1 and ptf2 is interpolated between pta1 and pta2.

ARGUMENT:: winSize
	The window size. As HPSS relies on spectral frames, we need to decide what precision we give it spectrally and temporally, in line with Gabor Uncertainty principles. http://www.subsurfwiki.org/wiki/Gabor_uncertainty

ARGUMENT:: hopSize
	The window hope size. As HPSS relies on spectral frames, we need to move the window forward. It can be any size but low overlap will create audible artefacts.

ARGUMENT:: fftSize
	The inner FFT/IFFT size. It should be at least 4 samples long, at least the size of the window, and a power of 2. Making it larger allows an oversampling of the spectral precision.

RETURNS::
	Nothing, as the various destination buffers are declared in the function call.
