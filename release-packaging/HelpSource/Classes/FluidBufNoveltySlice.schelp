DESCRIPTION::
This class implements a non-real-time slicer implementing an algorithm assessing novelty in the signal to estimate the slicing points. It implements the seminal results published in  'Automatic Audio Segmentation Using a Measure of Audio Novelty' by J Foote.  It is part of the Fluid Decomposition Toolkit of the FluCoMa project. footnote::This  was made possible thanks to the FluCoMa project ( http://www.flucoma.org/ ) funded by the European Research Council ( https://erc.europa.eu/ ) under the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (grant agreement No 725899).::

	The process will return a buffer which contains indices (in sample) of estimated starting points of different slices.


CLASSMETHODS::

METHOD:: process
This is the method that calls for the slicing to be calculated on a given source buffer.

ARGUMENT:: server
	The server on which the buffers to be processed are allocated.

ARGUMENT:: srcBufNum
	The index of the buffer to use as the source material to be sliced through novelty identification. The different channels of multichannel buffers will be summed.

ARGUMENT:: startAt
	Where in the srcBuf should the slicing process start, in sample.

ARGUMENT:: nFrames
	How many frames should be processed.

ARGUMENT:: startChan
	For multichannel srcBuf, which channel should be processed.

ARGUMENT:: nChans
	For multichannel srcBuf, how many channel should be summed.

ARGUMENT:: transBufNum
	The index of the buffer where the indices (in sample) of the estimated starting points of slices will be written. The first and last points are always the boundary points of the analysis.

ARGUMENT:: kernelSize
	The granularity of the window in which the algorithm looks for change, in samples. A small number will be sensitive to short term changes, and a large number should look for long term changes.

ARGUMENT:: threshold
	The threshold in the novelty curve, the latter being derived from running the kernel across the diagonal of the similarity matrix, and looking for peak of changes (NOT CLEAR)

ARGUMENT:: winSize
	The window size. As novelty estimation relies on spectral frames, we need to decide what precision we give it spectrally and temporally, in line with Gabor Uncertainty principles. http://www.subsurfwiki.org/wiki/Gabor_uncertainty

ARGUMENT:: hopSize
	The window hope size. As novelty estimation relies on spectral frames, we need to move the window forward. It can be any size but low overlap will create audible artefacts.

ARGUMENT:: fftSize
	The inner FFT/IFFT size. It should be at least 4 samples long, at least the size of the window, and a power of 2. Making it larger allows an oversampling of the spectral precision.

RETURNS::
	Nothing, as the various destination buffers are declared in the function call.
