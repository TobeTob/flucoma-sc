DESCRIPTION::
This Class performs basic compositing on buffers on the non-real-time thread. It avoids having to come back to the language side. It is part of the Fluid Decomposition Toolkit of the FluCoMa project. footnote::
This  was made possible thanks to the FluCoMa project (http://www.flucoma.org/) funded by the European Research Council (https://erc.europa.eu/) under the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (grant agreement No 725899).::

	The algorythm will take two buffer in, and will put the composited information at the provided dstBuf.


CLASSMETHODS::

METHOD:: process
	This method triggers the compositing.

ARGUMENT:: server
	The server on which the buffers to be processed are allocated.

ARGUMENT:: srcBufNumA
	The bufNum of the first source buffer.

ARGUMENT:: startAtA
	The starting point (in samples) from which to copy in the first source buffer.

ARGUMENT:: nFramesA
	The duration (in samples) to copy from the first source buffer.

ARGUMENT:: startChanA
	The first channel from which to copy in the first source buffer.

ARGUMENT:: nChansA
	The number of channels from which to copy in the first source buffer. This parameter will wrap around the number of channels in the source buffer.

ARGUMENT:: srcGainA
	The gain applied to the samples to be copied from the first source buffer.

ARGUMENT:: dstStartAtA
	The time offset (in samples) in the destination buffer to start writing the first source at. The destination buffer will be resized if the portion to copy is overflowing.

ARGUMENT:: dstStartChanA
	The channel offest in the destination buffer to start writing the first source at. The destination buffer will be resized if the number of channels to copy is overflowing.

ARGUMENT:: srcBufNumB
	The bufNum of the second source buffer.

ARGUMENT:: startAtB
	The starting point (in samples) from which to copy in the second source buffer.

ARGUMENT:: nFramesB
	The duration (in samples) to copy from the second source buffer.

ARGUMENT:: startChanB
	The first channel from which to copy in the second source buffer.

ARGUMENT:: nChansB
	The number of channels from which to copy in the second source buffer. This parameter will wrap around the number of channels in the source buffer.

ARGUMENT:: srcGainB
	The gain applied to the samples to be copied from the second source buffer.

ARGUMENT:: dstStartAtB
	The time offset (in samples) in the destination buffer to start writing the second source at. The destination buffer will be resized if the portion to copy is overflowing.

ARGUMENT:: dstStartChanB
	The channel offest in the destination buffer to start writing the second source at. The destination buffer will be resized if the number of channels to copy is overflowing.

ARGUMENT:: dstBufNum
	The bufNum of the destination buffer.

returns::
	Nothing, as the various destination buffers are declared in the function call.
