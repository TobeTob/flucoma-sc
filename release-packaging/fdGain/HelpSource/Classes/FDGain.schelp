DESCRIPTION::
A sanity test for the FluCoMa Real-Time Client Wrapper footnote::This  was made possible thanks to the FluCoMa project (http://www.flucoma.org/) funded by the European Research Council (https://erc.europa.eu/) under the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (grant agreement No 725899).::

CLASSMETHODS::

METHOD:: ar
	The audio rate version of the object.

ARGUMENT:: in
	The input to be processed

ARGUMENT:: frameSize
	The size of the real-time i/o buffer. It will add that much latency to the signal.

ARGUMENT:: gain
	Audio or control rate change of the gain.

returns:: nothing

INSTANCEMETHODS::

METHOD:: checkInputs
	This makes sure the value and phase inputs are both at audio rate.

returns::
	A slap on the wrist, should it not be the case.


EXAMPLES::
	Summing with the inverse (gain of -1) with a delay of the latency gives us CPU-expensive silence.
	code::
	{ var source = PinkNoise.ar(0.1); DelayN.ar(source,delaytime:1000/s.sampleRate) + FDGain.ar(source,1000,-1); }.play
	::
	Varying the gain at audio rate.
	code::
	{ FDGain.ar(PinkNoise.ar(0.1), gain:LFSaw.ar(1)) }.play
	::
	Varying the gain at comtrol rate.
	code::
	{ FDGain.ar(PinkNoise.ar(0.1), gain:LFSaw.kr(0.5)) }.play
